# Lichen-Universe
ALL my project in ONE place


## 🔗 Project Implementations

This repository acts as a unifying entry point for the Lichen research ecosystem.
Individual components are developed and versioned in dedicated repositories.

| Project Name | Description | Status | Repository |
|--------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Lichen OS** | Experimental cognitive systems architecture exploring machine-native data formats, resilience, and alignment metrics. | Experimental | https://github.com/quantum-lichen/lichen-OS.1.3 |
| **FC-496 Core** | Fixed-structure 496-bit data cell format with integrated error correction and structural coherence constraints. | Experimental | https://github.com/quantum-lichen/fc-496 |
| **UICT** | Unified Information Compression Theory — conceptual framework linking compression, coherence, and system stability. | Research | https://github.com/quantum-lichen/UICT |
| **CEML** | Cognitive Entropy Minimization Law — metric-based approach for detecting incoherent or unstable cognitive states. | Research | https://github.com/quantum-lichen/CEML |
| **H-Scale** | Harmonic evaluation metric for decision support based on coherence, efficiency, resonance, and durability. | Draft | https://github.com/quantum-lichen/H-Scale |
| **CRAID** | Cognitive RAID-inspired redundancy and reconstruction mechanisms for long-lived information systems. | Experimental | https://github.com/quantum-lichen/CRAID |
| **Genesis-QC** | Experimental application prototype focused on cognitive support and mental health alignment. | Prototype | https://github.com/quantum-lichen/genesis-qc |
